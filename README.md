### Hi. This is my virtual storage room.

Here you can find almost everything I've made, from [tiny little scripts](https://github.com/nstgeorge/rotatewm/blob/master/rotatewm.pl) to [large projects](https://github.com/nstgeorge/VEKTA). Don't go digging too deep, or you might find some awful code from high school or something. I just like keeping that stuff around!

I'm passionate about great UI/UX and have extensive experience with a wide range of web technologies. I have deep (and deepening) knowledge in a couple areas, but a wide (and widening) knowledge base across many aspects of computing. I also write music.
